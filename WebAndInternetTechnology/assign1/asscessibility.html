          <h3>Content</h3>
          <p>The website was created in consideration of color and descriptive phrases for accessibility. First, all letters were set in black or white so that even people with color blindness could read the website without much difficulty. In addition, a simple detailed description was written as a subheading along with the title on all pages so that it could be explained specifically what role each page plays and what it provides. In addition, this helps even blind people can quickly know what this page is about when they use a screen reader. In addition, the same style was applied to all pages to facilitate the use of the website, and the same logo was used on the left side of the navigation bar to show that the user was accessing the same website even when moving to another page.</p>
